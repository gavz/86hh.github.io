  <p><i>The following text was written in 2017.  Sadly, the original BEAUTIFULSKY code base of which the text is about is now lost, it would seem that nobody kept an online/offline copy of it.

  <p><i>However, a few people saved the text back then.  Now, I would like thank those who spent some time on own search and rescue missions. <b>Thank you.</b>  So here is available the text again.</i></p>

  </br>
  </br>
    <h1>Analysis of W32/64.Sofia and the new BEAUTIFULSKY code base</h1>
  </br>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Some years ago, I wrote my first cross-platform code which I named Sofia. This was primarily a Proof of Concept virus demonstrating how to mix x86 and x64 assembly.    Most of it consisted of detecting the execution mode coupled with
conditional statements that allowed it to run platform compatible code when needed. I <b>almost</b> achieved to create the world's first cross-platform virus code that had a single execution path.</p>

<p>Today, I want to review Sofia, and analyse the core techniques I thought and implemented, and compare them with a successor code base I named <i>BeautifulSky</i>. This article is a standalone, and don't need to have access to the source code of  both viruses to be understandable, but knowledge of x86/x64 assembly and W32/W64 is needed.</p>
  </br>
  
  <h3>BeautifulSky</h3>

<p>Before Sofia was created,  the virus writer <i>roy g biv</i> had published an article in 2009 detailing a new technique he called Heaven's Gate. This short article showed how to execute x64 code in a WoW64 (32-bit) process. His PoC virus W32/64.Heaven further demonstrated this feature of WoW64, and together with his W32/64.Shrug virus, inspired me to write Sofia.</p>

<p>Heaven only used its  technique to jump into 64-bit mode therefore much of its code was x64 using a native interface (NTDLL API).  Shrug48  stuck  together a x86 and a x64 version of itself.   Sofia was an attempt to make something like Shrug48, but more compact.    Now almost in 2018 with new operating systems in the  Windows  family,  and  the introduction of new protections in Windows 10, Heaven's Gate is no longer available so easily anymore for usermode.</p>

<p>What we  now  know  is  that  it's entirely possible to write a single x86/x64 assembly code  which can run in both 32-bit/64-bit  mode  by  using  carefully chosen encoding, a common API set, and the basic arithmetic we all know.</p>

</br>
<h3>What's new in BeautifulSky?</h3>

<p>
– uses the same code to run in both x86/x64 modes, single execution path</br>
– fully x86/x64 compatible encoding</br>
– no self-modifying code to achieve compatibility</br>
– position independent-code and compatible with Address Space Layout Randomization</br>
– uses Process Environment Block (PEB) to get kernel32/ntdll directly on both platforms</br>
– stdcall/x64 calling convention compatible</br>
– own GetProcAddress() that supports PE32/PE32+</br>
– uses CRC32 instead of name strings</br>
– uses Vectored Exception Handler for common exception handling on both platforms</br>

and still there is much more. :-)</br>
</p>

<p>BeautifulSky  searches the current directory for any file (e.g find mask *.*).
To  open  and  map  files for infection it uses an adapted and more  efficient
version of a technique used by W32.Cabanas virus by <i>Jacky Qwerty</i> in 1998.</p>

<p>The  code,  unlike Sofia's,  was  written in pure x86 code in good old masm32.
The  reason behind this is that it is easier to visualize what the  code looks
like in both x86/64.  It feels more natural for people to look at x86 assembly
code like this where prefixes are visible,  and the dual-mode execution can be
seen clearly.  In the text we will find that Sofia's code is x64, BeautifulSky
will be x86, and examples will be sometimes provided with code for both modes.</p>

</br>
<hr>
<h3>Obtaining the platform mode</h3>
<p>First, the code needs a function to obtain the mode – x86/x64 – in which  it's
running.  This  will  be  helpful  when  deciding  how  to  use  memory access 
instructions which are compatible with 32/64-bit pointers, etc.</p>

<p>Let's see that function from Sofia:</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_riprel.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>The function  in x64 mode has the effect of moving the  current IP to RCX, but
in x86  there is no equivalent instruction because EIP can't be used this way,
thus  the  value of ECX becomes zero.  So the function returns zero if x86, or
non-zero if x64.</p>

<p>Here  we  also learn about the first encoding difference,  let's read a bit of
Intel's documentation to learn more about it:</p>

<p>"REX prefixes are a set of 16 opcodes  that span one row of the opcode map and
occupy entries 40H to 4FH.  These opcodes represent valid instructions (INC or
DEC) in  IA-32 operating modes and in compatibility mode.  In 64-bit mode, the 
same  opcodes  represent  the instruction prefix REX and  are  not  treated as 
individual  instructions.  The  single-byte-opcode   forms   of   the  INC/DEC 
instructions are not available in 64-bit mode.  INC/DEC functionality is still 
available using ModR/M forms of the same instructions (opcodes FF/0 and FF/1)"</p>

<p>What we saw  there as dec eax (opcode 48h) in x86, is a REX prefix in x64 that 
turns the addressing and registers to 64-bit.</p>

<p>The  implementation  of  the function in Sofia served the purpose of directing
the flow of execution in a conditional way: “if this is x86 mode, then run x86
code for W32, else run x64 code for W64.”</p>

<p>In BeautifulSky, I created a new function after  learning the values of the CS 
segment register: 33h for W64, and different values for W32.  This  was a good
starting point and I decided to make the function return 0, or 1. Just one bit
to rule them all. ;)</p>

  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_pm1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

  <p>Later, I upgraded it to an architecture/platform-independent trick:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_pm2.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

  <p>XOR sets ZF=1.  In x86 DEC sets ZF=0, and SETZ sets CL=0.  In  x64  DEC is REX
prefix, no effect; SETZ sets CL=1.</p>

<p>But when qkumba saw my code, he made a smaller gem of detection code:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_qpm.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  
<p>XOR sets ZF=1.  ARPL instruction sets ZF=0 in x86.   But here is the trick: in
x64 mode, ARPL  opcode  was  reassigned to the MOVSXD instruction that doesn't
alter any flag, thus ZF=1.  With SETZ to CL, we get the bit that we need.</p>

<p>Of course, this code was too good not to use it. :)</p>

</br>
<hr>
<h3>Obtaining the Process Environment Block</h3>

<p>Both  Sofia  and  BeautifulSky first attempt to obtain the PEB address for two 
tasks:  get the image base of the host, and the pointer to PEB_LDR_DATA  where
the needed DLL's base addresses can be found to resolve API addresses.  In the
Thread Environment Block (TEB), the  pointer  to PEB is at offset 30h for W32, 
and 60h for W64.</p>

<p>Now the most common way to get the PEB address is this:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_peb1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>The  difference  in  encoding  and  platform  is  clear now: different segment 
register means different opcode, and  there is a  REX  prefix  because  of the
qword ptr [..].   I thought about how to solve this by adjusting the registers
depending the mode.   But  we  already  have  another problem, the REX prefix. 
If  altered accordingly, in x86 it becomes 64 48 fs:dec eax.  The  problem  is
that for x86: fs loses effect since MOV becomes an instruction apart and might
access invalid memory.</p>

<p>We  can't  exchange  places  between  prefixes to make it compatible both ways 
because  in  x64  that  would cause the addressing to be 32-bit, since the REX
prefix must go before the instruction opcodes to work.</p>

<p>There are some solutions.</p>

<p>One  is  to  use a double prefix which looks like this: 64 64 8B 31 fs:fs:mov.
It  works for x86, and in x64 mode the first prefix must be adjusted to 65 gs,
and the second to 48 dec eax, so it becomes 65 48 8B 31:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_peb2.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>This is a weird solution, but it is useful if the code doesn't start executing
via AddressOfEntryPoint.   Now let's think a solution if execution does starts
via AddressOfEntryPoint:</p>

<p>In both W32/W64 platforms, EBX/RCX is the address to the PEB.   So it wouldn't 
need  to  access the TEB and no segment registers!  Just  adjust  the register
according to the mode.</p>


    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_peb3.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>What  about  achieving the same with no self-modifying code? We can use CMOVcc 
to do that, but not using our platform function (that alters ECX/RCX register,
needed in x64 mode), we can do this instead:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_peb4.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  
<p>This trick is simple.  EAX/RAX  is  set to 0, and this makes SF=0. In x86 mode
dec eax sets SF=1. In x64, dec eax is REX prefix, thus EAX/RAX  and SF are not
altered.</p>

<p>No move occurs in x86 mode, and in x64 RCX (PEB pointer) is now in RBX, making
it both ways compatible.</p>

<p>This  solution  eventually  led  me  to  think differently on how to solve the
problem with the segment registers.  Can we use CMOVcc and decide when to move
from fs:[30h] or gs:[60h]? Yes, we can, let's do it:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_peb5.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  
<p>First, the PEB's offset 60h in the W64's TEB is assigned to EDX/RDX.  XOR sets
SF=0. In x86 DEC sets  SF=1, but in x64 DEC is a REX prefix. In x86 CMOVS sets
EBX with the PEB address.   But what happens in x64? The internal operation of
CMOVcc is to fetch the SRC operand before the conditional occurs.   This means
that in x64 there is also a read to fs:[30h].     This is why I didn't use the 
bit mode to dynamically calculate the right offset to the PEB.    However, the
way this instruction is encoded  with  hardcoded 30h offset,   in x64 makes it
read a DWORD from RIP going through FS but works.   If we would had calculated
the offset in EDX/RDX and encoded it as fs:[edx]/fs:[rdx], it would've failed,
assuming that at the time this code is executed, 60h is an invalid address.</p>

<p>The  next  CMOVS,  in  x86  mode moves ESP to EDX. Notice that the instruction 
doesn't  use  the  REX prefix, because it is only needed to take effect in x86
mode.  The  next  CMOVNS  is  a  little trickier, but we discussed this opcode 
arrangement  before.  We want to have the GS prefix before the REX.  In x86 it
will become gs:dec eax, and CMOVNS an instruction apart. In x64 it will become
cmovns rbx, qword ptr [rdx].  This arrangement disables the read from gs:[60h]
in x86, and  we  need  to have a valid memory field in EDX that the CMOVNS can
read, that's why only in x86 we moved ESP to EDX. In x64 moves the PEB address
to RBX.</p>

<p>This  technique  is currently used in BeautifulSky if the code does not starts
by AddressOfEntryPoint, but it's a decision that must be made before compiling
the code.</p>

<p>Now let's see what the entry point code in Sofia looked like:</p>
    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_ep1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>There  are  two  reasons  why this code can't seem to be combined:  1) because 
of the segment registers problem;  2) because the offset to dwImageBaseAddress
in PEB is 8 in W32, and 10h in W64.</p>

<p>First, the RVA (AddressOfEntryPoint is an RVA and DWORD for both platforms) is
pushed onto the stack. Next, call riprel, if x86, jump to x86 code...</p>

<p>Now see one of the entry point codes in BeautifulSky:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_ep2.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>Super different, isn't it?</p>

<p>First,  the RVA  is pushed onto the stack, and then all registers that need to
be preserved (remember there is no PUSHAD/POPAD instructions in x64). Next the
registers are adjusted accordingly to have the PEB address in EBX/RBX.</p>

<p>platform  is  called;  and  we  increase  ECX by 1, so  1  for x86, 2 for x64; 
multiply ECX by (dword * saved registers count), and store the  result in ESI,
now  it  has the offset to the RVA in the stack; multiply ECX by 8, and  store
the  result  in  EDX,  so  8  if  x86, 10h  in  x64,  now it has the offset to 
dwImageBaseAddress and it can now update the RVA.</p>

<p>Finally, we are done with this part!</p>

<p>In  the  case of the code that resolves kernel32 and ntdll's base address, the 
story  is  more of  the  same: divided code for Sofia because of difference in 
offsets; BeautifulSky calculates the offsets and the code is fully compatible,
even simpler.</p>

</br>
<hr>
<h3>Walking DLLs<h3>
<p>If  you  have  ever written code to parse a PE32 DLL and its export directory, 
you  will  be  happy  to know that RVAs continue to be 32-bit.  Therefore  the
IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY  and other structures continue to be the same for  both
PE32/PE32+.   However,  IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure did change: BaseOfData 
field is gone, Imagebase and SizeOf*Reserve/SizeOf*Commit are 64-bit.</p>

<p>As easy as it might be  travelling from the DOS header to the Export Directory
on a loaded DLL, I still managed to make one silly mistake in Sofia:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_dll1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>In  the  beginning EAX/RAX and EDX/RDX are set to the base address of the DLL, 
then  adds to AL the offset of the Export Directory (from the beginning of the 
PE header). riprel is used to determinate the mode, so  that  it  can  further
add  to  AL the difference of the offset  between the PE32 and PE32+. Next, in
both modes it adds the offset to the PE header.  Now EAX/RAX is the pointer to
Export Directory in the Data Directory.  It moves the RVA to ebp and correctly
adds the 64-bit base address of the DLL.</p>

<p>The bug is located in the add eax, dword ptr [edx + 3ch] instruction.  It is a
32-bit addition to the lower 32-bit section of the 64-bit register, this  type
of operation causes the upper 32-bit part to be zeroed in x64 mode.  Let's see
the path in x64 mode and the changes to RAX for more clarity:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_bug1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>It would  be  safe to think that Sofia should have never worked in 64-bit mode
then. But in his analysis of Sofia, Peter Ferrie states:</p>

<p><i>"it just so happens that the image base of both of those DLLs is always in the
low 2GB range, and  thus the size of the image base never exceeds 32 bits.  In
the case of kernelbase.dll and a number of other introduced DLLs, on the other
hand,  the  size  of  the  image base  does  exceed  32 bits. If the virus had 
attempted to access any APIs from such a DLL, then the bug would have caused a
crash."</i></p>

<p>BeautifulSky code is almost the same,  but  offsets differences are calculated
using the platform bit:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_dll2.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>CL=0  in  x86  mode,  or  CL=1  in  x64. I use the RVA of the Export Directory 
differently:  instead of having a pointer to IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY,  we  have
EBX/RBX with the RVA and EBP/RBP with the base address of the DLL:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_dll3.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>That's it for resolving API addresses. Both codes are very similar.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Calling APIs</h3>
<p>Some  of  you might be wondering how we can call APIs in a compatible way when
stdcall is entirely different from the x64 calling convention (x64CC).</p>

<p>In x64CC, the four first parameters are placed in registers RCX/RDX/R8/R9 with
the remainder stored on the stack.   A shadow space (4 slots * QWORD) to store
these  registers  is  required  on  the  stack  even if the API doesn't have 4
parameters.</p>

<p>The  call  must also be aligned to a 16-byte boundary in case the API uses SSE
instructions.  So, for example, a call to FindFirstFileW looks like this:</p>

<p>Assuming the stack is aligned at this point, here is the W64 version:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>We still need one more slot, because the return address unaligns the stack. In
offset 20h,   we would have those 8 more bytes to align.   One "sub rsp, 8" is
equivalent to a PUSH operation in 64-bit mode.  Thus it can be made compatible
this way:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api2.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>Basically, in x86 mode the arguments will be taken from the stack,  and in x64
mode from registers and the arguments for x86 are just shadow stack. :)</p>

<p>Let's see how this happens in Sofia:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api3.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>First,  EDI/RDI  becomes  the  stack-frame pointer for the API addresses list. 
A  buffer  is  allocated  for  WIN32_FIND_DATA structure and the arguments are
pushed to the stack as I described before.</p>

<p>We  can  see that EAX/RAX will hold an index for kFindFirstFileA (index in the
fashion of... 0, 1, 2...)  that  will be used to calculate the position of the
address in the stack,   and there is a call to  call_apisize  to calculate the
offset.   But  before  we  move  to  describe the function,  we can see a nice
call qword ptr [...] that is compatible for both platforms.  No prefix needed.</p>

<p>call_apisize gets the index in EAX/RAX, and... if 32-bit mode,  multiply by 4,
else by 8. And now you can feel my disappointment.</p>

<p>It is a simple as that.</p>

<p>BeautifulSky doesn't improve too much on this front.   It uses the API offsets
from x86 mode instead of index:</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api4.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>The  new  call_apisize  takes the platform bit to makes a shift-left by 0 or 1 
(same as multiplying by 2).  Now it has the right offset and jumps to the API.
When the API returns, it returns correctly after call dword ptr [esi].</p>

<p>Finding files is a loop, you might be wondering how we can make it to clean up
the stack after every call when in x86 mode the API (or callee)  cleans up the
stack with "retn N" but in x64CC they do not.  Could there be a chance for the
loop to overflow the stack with the arguments for FindNextFileW?  If the stack
is small, or there is just too many files, it could happen.</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api5.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>BeautifulSky does  not  release  the shadow space used in FindFirstFileW call, 
because it can use two slots for FindNextFileW().  This  API  will  add to new 
slots  that  must  be  released  before we can loop again: the platform bit is
shifted left to make it 10h only in x64, and add it to RSP and it's done.</p>

<p>I  included  a  new function in BeautifulSky to do the stack release for other
cases.  Sofia had the "if x86, release this much, else this much" type of code
again.  The new function is for convenience and future additions/alteration of
the code.  Now let's take for example,   SetFileAttributesW that take only two
arguments.</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_api6.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>In x86 mode it needs to release 2 slots that belong to x64 mode.   In x64 mode
it  needs  to  release  the  shadow  space entirely. release_stack dynamically
adjusts ESP/RSP and jumps back.</p>

</br>
<hr>
<h3>Exception handling with VEH for W32/W64</h3>

<p>SEH isn't available in W64 in the same way.     It became a table in the image
that  describes  where the protected code begins and where it ends,  describes 
the stack and registers, etc.   It also has a pointer to the exception handler
for that code.   It is possible to use APIs to use this table,   but it is not
compatible with W32.</p>

<p>When  I  made Sofia I also took the opportunity to create W64/Haley which uses
this table for an EntryPoint Obscuring technique.</p>

<p>The  solution instead is to use Vectored Exception Handlers that is API based,
and it works in both platforms.</p>

    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/sky_images/sky_veh1.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>

<p>This  is  how  I  still  do  it today.  You can see the stack-frame is set and 
registers  are  saved,   specifically  those that must survive an exception of 
catastrophic proportions, specially if we didn't intend to cause it. :)</p>

<p>Here is the entry point of the Vectored Handler in Sofia:<p>

    </br>

<p>The handler is divided and for a "good reason".  In W64, RCX is ExceptionInfo,
a pointer to the EXCEPTION_POINTERS struct. In W32 the pointer is sent via the
stack. Interesting problem back then.</p>

<p>Lets see how I solved it this time:</p>

<p>The trick is: in both modes it makes a pop of what should be ExceptionInfo: in
x86 mode it is, but in x64 mode poped the first slot in the shadow stack.  And
we make use of the CMOVcc trick again. Now the correct pointer is in RBX.</p>

<p>The second part to this is that it needs to make a  "retn 4"  operation in x86
mode but not in x64. The return address is safe in EDX/RDX, and the pointer is
out of the stack already with the pop eax.   In x64 however, we  have  to undo
that pop before we go back.</p>

<p>Lets see the second part of the handler in Sofia:</p>

<p>I  mentioned in the source code "VEH fixer must be separated", because offsets
of the registers in CONTEXT structure are different for W32/W64.   It is worth
to  mention  that  pop dword ptr is encoded the same as pop qword ptr, so they
are compatible for this case.</p>

  </br>

<p>Using  previous  tricks,  the  offset  to EIP/RIP in CONTEXT is calculated and 
EIP/RIP adjusted to a safe continuation point where execution will be resumed.
Finally the pop eax is fixed and jumps back to ntdll.</p>

<p>You  might  be  wondering  why  BeautifulSky's VEH  does not  restore  ESP/RSP
unlike Sofia's VEH. Basically, my idea was to make whatever piece of code that
came next, not using EDX/RDX, thus no need to restore it. A small detail worth
mentioning: EDX is at a higher offset than its RDX counterpart  in the CONTEXT
structure.  That needs some further calculation and more code.</p>

<p>Okay, so after all, it  was  possible  to make a compatible Vectored Exception
Handler code. :)</p>

<h3>Outro</h3>
<p>We  reviewed  all  the  main  points  where  code  was amended and made into a 
single execution path for BeautifulSky.  If I had been able to achieve it 6
years ago, I think these days I would regret that I did it.</p>

<p>I would like to send greetings and thank modexp and qkumba for their help with
writing this text.  It was the hardest part. ;)</p>
