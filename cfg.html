  <h1>Beam me up, CFG.</h1>
  
  <h3>What is CFG?</h3>
  <p>Earlier in 2018 while revisiting the Delay Import Table, I used <i>dumpbin</i> to check the Load Configuration data of a file and noticed new fields in it:</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_fields.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  <p>And at the time of writing this, more fields were added! The first <i>CFGuard</i> caught my attention and I learned about <b>Control Flow Guard</b>, it is a new security feature. To put it simple, it protects the execution flow from redirection - for example, from exploits that overwrite an address in the stack. Maybe they should call it the Security Directory instead. ;-)</p>
  <p>Let's take a look to it with dumpbin again, this is after SafeSEH entries in the Load Config:</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_lcdir.png" class="img-center" style="width: 60%; height: 60%;">
  </br>
  <p>The first entry is called <i>GuardCFCheckFunctionPointer</i> it is a pointer to variable called <i>__guard_check_icall_ptr</i> which holds a pointer to a function address called <i>@_guard_check_icall_nop@4</i> (it is also present in the table up here, to be protected):</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_icall_nop.png" class="img-center" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;">
  </br>
  <p>In static analysis of the code we can see it just returns.  Why?  Several reasons: Windows OS kernel may not support these new security feature(s) because it's only available for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 x86/x64, in this case the Loader doesn't do anything with CFG, the program runs as it would normally; if the file is a DLL and the main program for the process is not compiled with CFG enabled, it doesn't work for any other module loaded in the process; if DEP, CFG doesn't work; and some other reasons too.</p>
  <p>Now let's see when is this function called from the code:</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_code.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  <p>The function <i>__scrt_get_dyn_tls_init_callback</i> gets a pointer to a TLS callback table to call the first entry.  The callback function is protected by CFG so the compiler adds code (marked in green) to check if the function address is valid.</p>
  <p>When loading the image, if all conditions are met and CFG is good to work, the function <i>@_guard_check_icall_nop@4</i>'s address is replaced with a function address to NTDLL called <i>LdrpValidateUserCallTarget</i>:</p>
    </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_ntdll.png" class="img-center" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;">
  </br>
  </br>
   <h3>Introducing the CFGBitmap</h3>

<p>When loading the image in memory, after applying relocations the Loader sets up a bitmap in which every bit corresponds to every 8 bytes of (executable) memory in the process.  When available it takes the "Guard CF Function Table" RVA entries and sets the bits as valid entries.</p>
<p>When <i>LdrpValidateUserCallTarget(ecx == target address)</i> is called, it gets the address of the CFGBitmap from the <i>LdrsystemDllInitBlock</i> struct, makes a copy of the Target Address and shifts 8 bits to the right and uses the remaining bits as an offset to the bitmap from which it gets 32-bits of entries, and checks if the Target Address is aligned and if is a valid entry within that region.  If it's not, an exception occurs and the program terminates.</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_bitmap.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  <p>For this test the program is loaded at 0x009A0000 because of ASLR, the CFGBitmap is located almost after the end of the image in memory.  The RVA of the first section (.text) is 0x1000, so the VA is 0x009A1000.  We shift it right 8 bits and get 0x00009A10, and multiply it by 4 as is in the <i>LdrpValidateUserCallTarget</i>'s code and we can see a piece of the bitmap for the first section of the image.  The only bit set in the first 32 bits is for the first function in the CF Function Table!</p>
    </br>
   <h3>The silent killer.</h3>
   <p>When I started researching CFG, I wrote a proof of concept EntryPoint Obscuring virus called W64.SENSHI ("Guardian" in Japanese) to disable CFG in PE files and replace the address in <i>__guard_check_icall_ptr</i> with the address to the virus code. Every time a target address is to be checked, the virus is executed instead.</p>
   <p>It's funny because until recently I never thought that if viruses or tools that alter files in much the same way as a virus don't support CFG (and I bet none of them do except mine) they may break the infected file:
   if you alter the entrypoint which is guaranteed to be present in the CF Guard Table, the program crashes because it's checked to be valid before transferring control to it.  Or altering any other address which is checked in the code will cause the program to crash. I like this. :-) One solution is to add the address of your code to the table, and the address better be aligned.</p>
   
   <p>However, by disabling CFG in the file is also possible to use the CF Guard Table as a "cavity" and insert a decryptor away from the encrypted code. Or if it's large enough, maybe your code can fit in it.  I haven't seen a table so large yet.</p>
   </br>
   <h3>Introducing CFG Teleportation </h3>
   <p>I wondered for some time about the CFGBitmap but failed to implement it the first time.  Now I have it.  My idea is to create a CF Function Table with RVAs to unexisting functions, since the addresses are used to set bits in the bitmap for a memory region, I thought I could use it to rebuild the virus bit by bit.</p>
   <p>I created a custom PE file which supports DEP and ASLR, while the documentation states that CFG extends those features, it doesn't say that the image must have ASLR enabled for it to work, but it is needed, otherwise the CFGBitMap is allocated at a fixed address and all bits are set, making all targets valid; then I made the Load Config smaller than in the test because I only need it up to the GuardFlag field with the flags IMAGE_GUARD_CF_INSTRUMENTED and IMAGE_GUARD_CF_FUNCTION_TABLE_PRESENT.  After I created the Function Table and looked at the bitmap, I noticed that for some nybbles an additional bit is set.  Here is a dump of the bitmap with DWORDs from 0, 0x11111111, 0x22222222 ... 0xFFFFFFFF:</p>
  </br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/86hh/86hh.github.io/master/texts/cfg_images/cfg_badbits.png" class="img-center" >
  </br>
  <p>Only 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0xC, 0xD, 0xF nybbles are untouched.  I don't know why this happens, if someone does knows please contact me, I haven't given it too much thought, since the bits are always altered wherever they are, at least in my tests.  But maybe there is a way to fix it.  However, do notice that for cases like 0xA (1010) which is turned to 0xF (1111), it sets all bits in the nybble, not just one.</p>
  <p>Creating code with only the available nybbles is tricky, not much because of the instructions opcodes because you can replace some instructions for others, for example: MOVs which are encoded with 8x, you can replace with PUSH/POP; but most of the encoding for the operands is difficult because it makes fewer registers available to use.</p>
  
  <p>I couldn't find a solution to this problem and even I didn't think I would be able to make such a crafty code, only workarounds that would allow us to Beam Up something:</p>
  <p>
  1) Use an offset/nybble table to - after the virus is rebuilt in the bitmap - correct every nybble expected to be corrupted.</br>
  2) Use a substitution table.</br>
  3) Use a small and compatible decryptor but the virus would still be there.</br>
  </p>
  </br>
  <h3>Getting the CFGBitmap</h3>
  <p>Since my PE file supports and uses CFG I chose where I wanted the address of <i>LdrpValidateUserCallTarget</i> to be stored, it's something like this:</p>
  <pre>
Entrypoint:
mov     esi, "hh86"                   ;GuardCFCheckFunctionPointer points to the DWORD
mov     esi, dword [esi + 2]          ;get the address of the LdrsystemDllInitBlock+offset of the CFGBitmap field
mov     esi, dword [esi]              ;get the CFGBitmap address
mov     eax, dword [ebx + 8]          ;ebx = fs:[30h] at start time, get our image base from PEB
add     eax, 2000h                    ;2000h is our first RVA in the table, it's the first bit to be marked
shr     eax, 8                        ;shift-right 8 bits to make the offset
lea     esi, dword [esi + eax * 4]    ;now esi points to our code in the bitmap
  </pre>
  
  <p>And that would be all. :-)</p>
